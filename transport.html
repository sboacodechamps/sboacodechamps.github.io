        <p class="hometext">
          The future of transportation is moving towards new eco-friendly sources of energy and smarter technologies for
          autonomous navigation that will eliminate accidents. Travel will be safer, easier and much faster if not
          instantaneous!

          Cars would self-drive, Hyperloops will replace trains and Teleporting Pods will make instant travel a reality!
          Clean energy with zero emissions, enhanced safety features and comfort will be a given. Laser driven engines
          used instead of combustion engines, dashboard displays beamed onto the driver's helmet, fully autonomous
          navigation are just a few glimpses of a Future Land Vehicle!

      <p class="airtext">
        Aircrafts will be eco-friendly, silent, autonomous and cheaper! We might even have personal air transportation
        such as jetpacks and hoverboards! Air taxis will make intra city travel faster. Multiple innovations are leading
        the change but the major change will be travel for pleasure making aircrafts way more comfortable and cosy. As
        most business will be done virtually, the only reason to travel will be for fun!

          <p class="watertext">
            90% of the worlds cargo is moved through ships, making it the most polluting industry. Energy Observer is a
            zero emission prototype whos sails have been replaced by solar panels that power electric motors. It has a
            hydrogen power generation system, using an electrolyser to split seawater into hydrogen and oxygen. The
            hydrogen is compressed and stored in tanks until its needed, where a fuel cell converts the hydrogen back
            into water, releasing electrical energy in the process. Two 12-metre-tall Oceanwings sit on either side of
            the craft, providing extra wind propulsion.

        <p class="spacetext">
          The final frontier of space may finally be conquered by light sails, quantum drives and nuclear fusion
          technology that might make travel at the speed of light possible! Space X's reusable rockets, NASA's Curiosity
          Rover and the Voyager that's reached the distant shores of our solar system are all baby steps to making
          humans a space faring civilization.
